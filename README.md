# MrctBot
A simple bot that substitutes words in posts using MS Linguistic Analyzers.

It composes a tree using "The Martian" Chapter 1 by Andy Weir. 
Whenever it gets a post it builds a tree again with Linguistics Analyzers and substitutes grammatically matching words in it.
As a reply you get the grammatically identical phrase (from the analyzer point of view) keeping punctuaiton marks at the places.
